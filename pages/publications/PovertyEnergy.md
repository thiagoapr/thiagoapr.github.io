### Poverty and Energy Transition: a Multinomial Analysis for Households in Brazil
(with S. Goncalves)

Energy poverty is a broad concept for which there are many different definitions, although all the definitions are based on households or individuals that do not meet minimum conditions of energy adequacy and suffer a certain degree of deprivation. This work aims to analyze the relationship between income and inadequate access to cooking fuels, such as
firewood and charcoal, for Brazilian rural families. For this purpose, we use the 2016 PNAD Contínua (IBGE) microdata and estimate a multinomial logit, controlling for characteristics related to the families' preferences, for a set of three possible alternatives for choosing fuel for food preparation: LPG, biomass, and LPG and biomass, under the concept of energy poverty based on the technological approach. Among the main results of the study, we highlight that an increase in per capita household income reduces the probability of using the combination of biomass and LPG and further reduces the probability of exclusive use of biomass, in relation to the probability of exclusive use of LPG. Moreover, the fact that exclusive use of biomass is more frequent among extremely poor families and the combined use of LPG and biomass is more frequent among poor households shows that the energy transition process in which families gradually migrate from biomass for the consumption of clean fuels occurs in parallel with a broader movement of gradual and general improvement in the welfare conditions of families, that is, energy poverty would be only one of the faces
of multidimensional family poverty.
